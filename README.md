# Dissertation-relation-extraction
Dissertation work done for my Master's degree. 


Data source: https://github.com/thunlp/DocRED

### Implementation

<li>Input: Take either train_annotated.json or dev.json as input json file from DocRED dataset

<li>This code can be used to generate a TSV file format to be used as input to R-BERT model to predict relations from DocRED dataset.

<li>Modified implementation of R-BERT is also provided
 



Sample tsv and label.txt files are provided under R-BERT/data/fold_0 for better understanding of the code.

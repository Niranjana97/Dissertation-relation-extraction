P276	After the landings in Normandy and Provence , the paramilitary components of the <e1> Resistance </e1> were organised more formally , into a hierarchy of operational units known , collectively , as the French Forces of the Interior ( FFI ) . It was also politically and morally important to <e2> France </e2> , both during the German occupation and for decades afterward , because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative , countering an existential threat to French nationhood .
P607	<e1> Resistance </e1> cells were small groups of armed men and women ( called the Maquis in rural areas ) , who , in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities , were also publishers of underground newspapers , providers of first - hand intelligence information , and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines .

P31	The <e1> French Resistance </e1> played a significant role in facilitating the Allies ' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 , and the lesser - known invasion of Provence on 15 August , by providing military intelligence on the German defences known as the Atlantic Wall and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle . Resistance cells were small groups of armed men and women ( called the <e2> Maquis </e2> in rural areas ) , who , in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities , were also publishers of underground newspapers , providers of first - hand intelligence information , and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines .
P527	The actions of the <e1> Resistance </e1> stood in marked contrast to the collaboration of the French regime based at Vichy , the French people who joined the pro - Nazi Milice française and the French men who joined the Waffen SS . Although the amalgamation of the <e2> FFI </e2> was , in some cases , fraught with political difficulties , it was ultimately successful , and it allowed France to rebuild the fourth - largest army in the European theatre ( 1.2 million men ) by VE Day in May 1945 .
